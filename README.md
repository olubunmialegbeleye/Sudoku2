### How It Works
The app uses a **backtracking algorithm** to solve Sudoku puzzles. Here's a brief overview of the algorithm:

1. Start from the top-left cell.
2. Find an empty cell.
3. Place a number (1-9) in the cell and check if itâ€™s valid:
    - No repetition in the current row, column, or 3x3 grid.
4. If valid, move to the next cell.
5. If invalid, backtrack to the previous cell and try the next number.
6. Repeat until the puzzle is solved or determined unsolvable.
